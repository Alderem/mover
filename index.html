              Since the DRC left D’ni in our hands in 2011, we have been the de
              facto caretakers of the history and culture. There were promises
              of large explorer involvements - allowing anything from new
              stories being told to problems being fixed and whole new areas
              being opened up. But what have we seen from this? Although much
              work has been done by explorers, only few effects are felt in the
              cavern. Why is this?

              To understand the current situation, we have to know how we got
              here. Three important groups within the Uru volunteer community
              are H'uru, the Guild of Writers, and OpenUru.

              Given all of these great achievements, and the intention that Cyan
              voiced to open Myst Online up for community involvement, one may
              wonder why only so few of the achievements have been accepted onto
              the official MOULa server.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software development is hard, even when all people involved are
              passionate about the project. However, it seems that
              <span class="font-weight-bold"
                >over the last decade, OpenUru has been a bottleneck for MOULa
                development</span
              >. They are working with a very small and closed team and it is
              difficult for others to contribute from the outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              To illustrate the amount of work that is being withheld from
              implementation on MOULa, examine one of the largest components of
              open source Uru: the client engine. The below shows the
              <span
                class="pop"
                data-content="The size of the discs is based on the amount of commits in all branches of the <a href='https://github.com/H-uru/Plasma' target='_blank'>H'uru</a> and <a href='https://bitbucket.org/OpenUru_org/cwe-ou/' target='_blank'>OpenUru</a> projects respectively. The overlap is a guess: although H'uru will generally incorporate work from OpenUru, there are exceptions (like merge commits)."

                commits</span

              created by OpenUru and H'uru respectively (227 and 2241) since
              2011. The OpenUru portion represents what is in MOULa, all else has not been accepted yet.

              class="img-fluid mb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            />
            <p>
              Also of note is the largest gap in time between consecutive
              commits to the respective client engine projects, visualised in
              time below. This shows how the OpenUru project at one point lay
              dormant for nearly two years, while the largest hiatus for the
              H'uru project lasted four months.

                Interested contributors and builders are discouraged by the lack
                of progress and eventually leave the community. Only a fraction

              Anyone putting any time and effort into this obscure project must
              be doing it as a labour of love. And rightly so! Uru has the
              potential to become a truly unique place within the gaming
              landscape. But it will not make good on its open-source promise if
              those who want to contribute are not given the possibility to do
              so.

              Ideally, OpenUru would open up and create an easier environment
              for Uru collaboration. If such changes do not occur,
              plans must be made to
              create an alternative to the OpenUru pipeline, so that more
              independence and openness can be achieved. Among other things,
              this would involve

              please get in touch with the GoW!
